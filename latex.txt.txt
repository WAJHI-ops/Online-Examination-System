% ----------- CHAPTER 6: System Design Specification -----------
\section{System Design Specification}
\subsection{System Architecture}
The Online Examination System adopts a three-tier client-server architecture to ensure modularity and scalability within the constraints of a local WAMP/XAMPP server. The architecture comprises:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer}: Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, delivering a black-themed, responsive interface for students, teachers, and admins. It communicates with the server via HTTP requests and AJAX calls.
    \item \textbf{Application Layer}: Implemented using PHP 8.2, handling business logic such as user authentication, exam management, and result processing.
    \item \textbf{Data Layer}: Powered by MySQL 8.0, storing user data, exam details, questions, results, and feedback in relational tables.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
% \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{architecture.png} % Insert architecture diagram
\caption{Three-Tier System Architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Database Design}
The MySQL database consists of the following key tables with relationships:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Users} (user\_id, username, password, role, email): Stores student, teacher, and admin credentials.
    \item \textbf{Exams} (exam\_id, title, teacher\_id, date, duration): Stores exam metadata.
    \item \textbf{Questions} (question\_id, exam\_id, text, option1, option2, option3, option4, correct\_answer): Stores exam questions.
    \item \textbf{Results} (result\_id, student\_id, exam\_id, score, timestamp): Stores student scores.
    \item \textbf{Feedback} (feedback\_id, user\_id, comment, timestamp): Stores user feedback.
\end{itemize}
Primary keys (e.g., user\_id, exam\_id) and foreign keys (e.g., teacher\_id in Exams, exam\_id in Questions) ensure data integrity.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
% \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{erd.png} % Insert ERD
\caption{Entity-Relationship Diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Module Design}
The system is divided into the following modules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication Module}: Manages user registration, login, and role-based access using PHP sessions and MySQL queries.
    \item \textbf{Exam Management Module}: Enables teachers to create, update, and delete exams and questions via PHP forms and MySQL CRUD operations.
    \item \textbf{Result Processing Module}: Calculates scores and generates rankings using PHP algorithms, storing results in MySQL.
    \item \textbf{Feedback Module}: Collects user input through HTML forms, processed by PHP and stored in MySQL.
    \item \textbf{Frontend Module}: Delivers dynamic, black-themed interfaces with JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., exam timers) and CSS for responsiveness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Flow Diagram}
The systemâ€™s data flow is illustrated in a Level-1 DFD, showing interactions between users, processes, and the database. For example, a student submits exam answers via the frontend, which PHP processes and stores in MySQL, then retrieves results for display.
